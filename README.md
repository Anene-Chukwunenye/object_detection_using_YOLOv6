# Object_detection_using_YOLOv6


## Concept
#### YOLOv6 is a single-stage object detection framework dedicated to industrial applications.
#### YOLO divides an image into a grid system, and each grid detects objects within itself. It can be used for real-time inference and require very few computational resources.
#### YOLOv6-M/L also achieves better accuracy performance than other detectors with a similar inference speed.

### Installation process
##### git clone https://github.com/meituan/YOLOv6
##### cd YOLOv6
##### pip install -r requirements.txt
